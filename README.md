# Unit8-VehicleBuilder

## Description

I built a TypeScript command-line application where the users are able to either create a new vehicle, or select an existing one. The application can be initialized by running the
command npm start. The users can create a new vehicle, which can be a car, a truck, or a motorbike. Each of these have their specifications, such as VIN, color, make,
model, year, weight, top speed, the number of wheels, and wheels diameter. When the users seelect to create a new vehicle, they are able to enter
all the required specifications. After that, there is a list of actions that can be performed by the new created vehicle, such as start vehicle, stop it,
turn right or left, accelerate or deaccelerate, as well as other actions that can be performed only by specific vehicles, like wheelies (motorbikes), and tow (trucks).
Also, the user can view a list of existing vehicles, and perform actions with them. After the actions, there are options to either create a new vehicle, select an existing one, or exit the application.
